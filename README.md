# 🛡️ Incident Report Analysis – DDoS Attack (NIST Cybersecurity Framework)

This project was developed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate – Course 3: Networks and Network Security**.  
It demonstrates how to apply the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to analyze and respond to a simulated **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack targeting a multimedia organization’s internal network.

## 📘 Project Overview

In this case study, a company experienced a major **network outage** caused by an **ICMP flood attack**.  
As a cybersecurity analyst, I documented the entire incident using the NIST CSF methodology — **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover** — to analyze the attack, outline containment procedures, and recommend long-term preventive strategies.

This project highlights both **technical and analytical** cybersecurity skills essential for entry-level analysts.

## ⚙️ NIST CSF Analysis Summary

### 1. Identify  
- Classified the incident as a **DDoS (ICMP Flood)** targeting internal network infrastructure.  
- Discovered the root cause: an **unconfigured firewall** allowing unrestricted inbound ICMP packets.  
- Determined affected assets: routers, servers, and client-facing applications.  

### 2. Protect  
- Implemented **firewall rule updates** to limit ICMP packet rates and verify source IP addresses.  
- Introduced **network segmentation** to isolate critical systems.  
- Enhanced **security policies**, access controls, and staff awareness training.  

### 3. Detect  
- Deployed **IDS/IPS** and **SIEM** solutions to monitor traffic and generate real-time alerts.  
- Established **baseline traffic patterns** to identify anomalies quickly.  
- Regularly audited network logs and performed penetration testing to ensure early detection.  

### 4. Respond  
- Contained the attack by **blocking malicious ICMP traffic** and isolating impacted systems.  
- Conducted **forensic log analysis** to identify attack origins.  
- Updated the **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** and improved communication protocols during incidents.  

### 5. Recover  
- Restored all critical systems from verified clean backups.  
- Performed **system integrity checks** to confirm successful remediation.  
- Conducted a **post-incident review** to integrate lessons learned into organizational policies.
